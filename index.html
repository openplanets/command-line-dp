  <h1>Command Line Digital Preservation</h1>
  <p>This project holds the resources I put together for the OPF's Digital
    Preservation At Your Command Webinar (08/11/2012). This, first version
    simply lists my notes from the session with some links to good reference
    sources on some of the commands.</p>
  <p>I will put a few example, well commented, bash scripts up during
    November that show how to further automate the basic manifest process shown
    in the Webinar.</p>
