FIDIR: FIDO + DIR 
part of the OPF webinar "Digital Preservation at your command part II"
http://www.openplanetsfoundation.org/
http://www.openplanetsfoundation.org/opf-webinars-recordings

to run this you'll need Python 2.7+ (won't yet work with Python 3+) and FIDO
http://www.openplanetsfoundation.org/software/fido

This is an example how to combine command line utilities
to create new functionality. Calling FIDO with a path
is probably better, but this is more educational
 
See the script and bash_alias.txt for more information
